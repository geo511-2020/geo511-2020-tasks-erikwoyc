A lot of the spatial data operations in this weeks reading were very interesting
because as a GIS user, it was cool to see the same functions performed in only a
couple lines of code. For instance sub-setting using filter, st_instersect(), 
st_join(), st_touches() and st_us_within_distance(), allow you to join geographical
data sets that either overlap or do not within a line or two of code. The 
st_transform() function also allows you to quickly transform data sets prior
to a join, allowing you to effectively, transform, join and filter spatial
data in a couple lines, which compared to the amount of windows you have to work
through to do the same thing in GIS, I thought that it was very cool to learn.
