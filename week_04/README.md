 One set of functions I thought to be really helpful is the pivot_longer()
 and the pivot_wider() functions because in data sets that are not clean
 these functions help to fix issues such as a variable being spread across 
 multiple columns or rows. This is shown very clearly in the figures such as
 table2 with the pivot_wider() function.

 I also thought the filter joins were pretty cool functions. The semi_join(x,y)
 and anti_join(x,y) seem to be really helpful when you are working with data from
 filtered summary tables and you want to match it back to an original set of data.
 Like most of the functions in this weeks reading, I find that it is really cool
 how you can clean and manipulate data sets to make it more digestible to best 
 achieve whatever it is you wish to do with that set of data.
