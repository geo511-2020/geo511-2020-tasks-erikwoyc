# Introduction to problem/question
  
# Problem / Question
I would like to run an analysis on housing prices in the City of Buffalo. I want to display my results with map visuals and provide a multiple linear regression to illustrate what variables had the greatest effect on housing prices. 
Additionally, I would like to compare the change in housing prices across Buffalo neighborhoods. 
# Inspiring Examples

## Example 1

These types of graphics are what I hope to produce in my project. The first using a Buffalo basemap and the Tax Assessor's location data. The facet function was used here to visualize the change in prices
overtime, which is one of the main goals of my project. The second, to show change in housing prices based on neighborhood using ggplot. For more information on this project see link.

## Example 2

https://rpubs.com/ablythe/520912

This project aimed to predict the housing prices in California in 1990 based on a number of 
possible location-based predictors. Although this project is a higher level than what I intend to 
do for my project, I felt that this was an interesting example to explore the possibilities within
a housing price analysis. Examples of some graphics produced from this project include Predicted Price Over/Under Actual Price.

## Example 3

Like Example 2, this project is a little more complicated than what I intend to do but a similar
data set (City Assessor's data) was used to build this model, and I found it helpful to understand how 
other people tackled this kind of project.

# Proposed methods

Proposed Packages: Ggplot2, ggmap, dplyr
I intend to clean my data and view a few variables using ggplot. I then intend to run a linear regression (http://r-statistics.co/Linear-Regression.html), 
create a summary table of results and some associated scatter plots to investigate and visualize possible indicators of price. 
Using ggmap, buffalo housing will be mapped based on price or potentially change in price over time. 
Another possible avenue of investigation could be looking at prices by year built and mapping changes in price based on the decade a house was built. 
One possible way of doing this could be to group houses (year built) in decades and run an ANOVA to examine variance in housing prices by decade. 
Finally, I hope to create map that shows a comparison of these results across neighborhoods using the neighborhood shapefile. 

# Expected results
I hope to successfully run some statistical analysis as outlined in methods and produce some plots to visualize the data from that analysis. 
In addition, maps will be created similar to example one as well as possible a map showing prices or price change across neighborhoods. To provide further detail of the data
used in this analysis, plots of a couple variables and summary tables of the linear regression will be created as well.
