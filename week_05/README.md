In the readings for this week, I found the section on spatial
subsetting to be particularly useful because it shows alternative
ways to select features of spatial objects based on whether or not 
they relate in space to another object. Functions such as st_intersects(),
st_within() and st_touches() all reminded me of selecting by location within 
GIS. These methods of selecting features by spatial relation or attribute 
are very helpful in organizing and isolating data of interest.
